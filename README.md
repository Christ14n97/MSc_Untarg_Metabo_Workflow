# Untargeted Metabolomics Workflow

This repository includes a PDF output from my Jupyter Notebook where the general workflow I applied to my untargeted metabolomics chemometrics analysis is described.

The [workflow](https://github.com/Christ14n97/MSc_Untarg_Metabo_Workflow/blob/master/Multivariate_Analysis_Metabolomics_Workflow.pdf) covers an introduction to the experimental data to afterwards show the data manipulation and data analysis performed with Python.

Furthermore, as at the end of my thesis I had a few Python modules I developed with the aim of making my code less redundant, more readable and speed-up my analysis. I show how to use what soon will be first Python library. The aim is to provide of high-level tools to perform chemometrics analysis using Python programming languages.
