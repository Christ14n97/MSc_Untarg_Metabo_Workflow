# Untargeted Metabolomics - Multivariate Analysis Workflow

This repository focus on a PDF where the general data analysis workflow I applied along my MSc thesis. It starts with multivariate analysis of both flavors: unsupervised and supervised. Later,
analysis of [MetaboRank](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29982278/) output, showing how to look for suggested metabolites in a set of features.

The [workflow](https://github.com/Christ14n97/MSc_Untarg_Metabo_Workflow/blob/master/Multivariate_Analysis_Metabolomics_Workflow.pdf) covers an introduction to the experimental data to afterwards show the data manipulation and data analysis performed with Python.

Furthermore, as at the end of my thesis I had a few Python modules I developed with the aim of making my code less redundant, more readable and speed-up my analysis. I show how to use what soon will be my first Python library. The aim is to provide of high-level tools to perform chemometrics analysis using Python programming language.
